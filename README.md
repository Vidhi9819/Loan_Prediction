# Loan_Prediction

ðŸš¨: ProjectðŸš¨
Task: Apply the specified Supervised ML Algorithm using the provided  Dataset
The ML Algorithm to be applied in the project are
Support Vector Machines
Logistic Regression
K Nearest Neighbour
Decision Tree
The Dataset provided contains missing data. in order to make it usable,u need to apply necessary Missing value handling Techniques
And also u need to apply Encoding methods in order to make it compatible for the models
Task Results: The Project should find the accuracy of different models trained on the DataSet and show the comparison between them
